# Speech2Filename
This python script will rename .wav files with the speech recognized inside of them.
I had to use Python 3.6. 
Make sure to put an input and output directory on lines 5 and 6.

This uses Google's speech recognition API, so your files will end up in the cloud if you use this script.
